# Digits-Recognition-using-deep-learning
When learning deep learning everbody seems to be choosing one project that is recogition of digits. i believe it gives us the basic idea of how image classification/recoginition or vactorisation works so i will do the same.
i will using dataset provided by pytorch library with digts photos.
will be doing this project on google colab as i do not have any gpu and colab environment provides us the gpu.
